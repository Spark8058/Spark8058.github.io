# FRC Team Scouting Website

## Overview
This project is designed to help FRC teams efficiently scout and analyze data during competitions. The scouting platform allows teams to gather performance data, export it in PDF and Excel formats, and see the statistics better and easier. Also makes it easier to share it.
